# Project Overview

In today's fast-paced financial world, loan approval is a critical process for banks and lenders. This project builds an automated, reliable, and scalable model to predict loan approvals. The system aims to improve speed, consistency, and fairness in lending decisions while maintaining strong predictive accuracy.

# Dataset

**Link:** `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n1I3hEcgN-YKycu174QRVXcqW2xmQk99/view`

> The dataset contains historical loan application records with applicant demographics, credit information, and financial variables. Some records may contain missing or inconsistent values which the pipeline handles during preprocessing.

---

# Problem Definition

Create a binary classification model that predicts `Approved` vs `Rejected` for incoming loan applications using features such as:

- Demographics: Age, marital status, education, employment.
- Credit: Credit score, outstanding debts, past defaults.
- Financial: Monthly income, loan amount, loan term, debt-to-income ratio.
- Behavioral / Socio-economic: Housing situation, employment type, etc.

Challenges include missing data, class imbalance, potential biases, and evolving financial contexts.

# Features / Predictors (examples)

- `age`
- `gender`
- `marital_status`
- `education_level`
- `employment_status`
- `employment_length` (years)
- `monthly_income`
- `loan_amount`
- `loan_term_months`
- `debt_to_income_ratio`
- `credit_score`
- `num_open_credit_lines`
- `past_delinquencies`
- `housing_status` (rent/own)
- `application_date`
- `loan_purpose`

> Adjust mapping according to actual column names in the dataset.

# Approach

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — understand distributions, missingness, correlations, and class balance.  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numerical features, create engineered features (e.g., monthly payment, loan-to-income ratio).  
3. Train/Test Split — use stratified split to preserve class distribution. Consider time-based split if dataset has temporal ordering.  
4. Model Training — compare several classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost/LightGBM, and a simple Neural Network).  
5. Hyperparameter Tuning — use cross-validation and grid/random search (or Bayesian optimization).  
6. Evaluation — use metrics appropriate to business needs (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC) and a confusion matrix.  
7. Explainability & Fairness — SHAP or LIME for feature importance and bias checks across protected groups.  
8. Deployment — package the best model and preprocessing pipeline for inference (e.g., with `joblib`, REST API, or a lightweight server).

# Data Preprocessing (recommended pipeline)

- **Missing values**
  - Numerical: median/mean or model-based imputation.
  - Categorical: new category `Unknown` or mode imputation.
- **Outliers**
  - Winsorize or transform skewed variables (log, box-cox).
- **Feature engineering**
  - `loan_to_income = loan_amount / monthly_income`
  - `monthly_payment_estimate` using amortization formula
  - `income_bracket` from monthly income
- **Encoding**
  - Categorical: One-Hot (if few categories) or Target/Ordinal encoding (for high-cardinality)
- **Scaling**
  - StandardScaler or RobustScaler for numerical features
- **Dimensionality**
  - PCA only if needed for specific models or visualization

# Modeling (suggested models & baseline)

- **Baseline**: Logistic Regression with class weight balancing.
- **Tree-based**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM (often strong performers on tabular data).
- **Neural Network**: small MLP if dataset is large enough.
- **Ensemble**: Stacking / Voting of the best models.

**Handling class imbalance**
- Class weights in loss function
- Resampling: SMOTE, ADASYN, or undersampling majority class (use carefully)

---

# Evaluation

Key metrics to report (choose based on business priority):

- **Accuracy** — overall correctness (can be misleading with imbalance)
- **Precision** — of approved predictions, how many were correct (important if false approvals are costly)
- **Recall (Sensitivity)** — proportion of actual approvals correctly identified (important if missing true approvals is costly)
- **F1-score** — harmonic mean of precision & recall
- **ROC-AUC** — discrimination ability across thresholds
- **PR-AUC** — useful when classes are imbalanced
- **Confusion Matrix** — case counts for TP, FP, TN, FN

Also report:
- Calibration plot (is predicted probability meaningful?)
- Feature importance (global & local via SHAP)
